# UnderSampling-
What is Churn Rate? The churn rate is the percentage of subscribers to a service who discontinue their subscriptions to the service within a given time period. For a company to expand its clientele, its growth rate, as measured by the number of new customers, must exceed its churn rate.  Problem Statement When I was interning with a Multinational Telecom Company, there the Data Science Team was working on this problem. But their dataset was a huge one. Here I have provided one simple dataset.   So, here the Company wants a model which can predict that how likely its current customers will leave the company in near future and hence calculate its churn rate.  This is a Classification Problem in which you'll classify a customer based on his/her Credit Score, Region, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, Salary etc. whether he/she will EXIT(1) or NOT(0).
